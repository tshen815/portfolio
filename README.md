# My Portfolio Site

https://tonyshen.io

This is my web portfolio that I built from scratch using Javascript, HTML5, CSS3 in order to showcase some of my work and projects and to tell you a little bit about myself.
I chose to eschew React and other libraries/frameworks as I wanted to have a deeper understanding of HTML and CSS and to get back to the fundamentals of web development. Having
a solid understanding of the fundamentals and how things work under the hood is always a goal of mine!

The site is responsive and available for mobile view and was deployed using github pages. I am currently working on improving the optimization for the site in order to get full 100s on
my Lighthouse audit (currently at 97) in order to provide an even better user experience. I believe that any coding endeavor can be constantly improved over time and I will be tinkering with my 
site to add any new ideas that come up. If you notice any issues or having any suggestions when visiting, please feel free to open on an issue on the repo and I'll take a look!
